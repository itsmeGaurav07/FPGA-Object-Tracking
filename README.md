# Object Tracking Using FPGA

## Overview
This project implements a real-time object tracking system using FPGA.
The design is developed using Verilog HDL and synthesized using Vivado.
Hardware-based processing enables faster performance compared to software approaches.

## Objective
- To design an object tracking system using FPGA
- To achieve real-time performance using hardware logic
- To understand image/video processing concepts on FPGA

## Tools & Technologies
- Vivado Design Suite
- Verilog HDL
- FPGA Development Board

## Project Structure
- `src/` : Verilog source files (object tracking logic)
- `tb/` : Testbench files for simulation
- `constraints/` : XDC constraints file
- `docs/` : RTL schematic, simulation waveforms, synthesis results

## Methodology
1. Video/image data is processed using FPGA logic
2. Object features are extracted using hardware modules
3. Object position is tracked frame by frame
4. Output is verified through simulation and synthesis

## Results
- Successful synthesis and implementation in Vivado
- Object movement tracked in real time
- Verified using simulation waveforms

## Applications
- Surveillance systems
- Autonomous robots
- Smart traffic monitoring
- Industrial automation

## Future Enhancements
